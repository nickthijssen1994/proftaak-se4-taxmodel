# Proftaak SE4 TaxModel
Angular Frontend and .NET Core Backend Project for Software Semester 4 2020.

# Git Guidelines

When starting working on a feature, create a feature branch based on the develop branch.
Name the new feature branch according to what the feature is, for example `feature-login`.
The branch should be named as in the example, so lowercase and `-` between seperate words.
When the feature is complete, merge the branch with develop.
Then merge the develop branch with the testing branch.
When all tests pass, request a merge with the master branch.
